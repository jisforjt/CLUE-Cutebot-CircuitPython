# Clue-Cutebot
This is a higher level library to allow Adafruit's [Clue](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500) and ElecFreak's micro:bit Smart [Cutebot](https://www.elecfreaks.com/micro-bit-smart-cutebot.html) to cummunicate while maintaing all the functionality of the Clue, except for touch features. I am a teacher of young learns and as such the code was perposefully left simple so I can use it with them. There is also a comment on nearly every line to help explain to my students what each line is doing.
